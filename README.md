# Maze Generator With Cellular Automaton
This an old project I used as an HelloWorld for my gitHub.
It was in 2020 when I was learning Java. I had an homework wich was to creat a maze generator. I came up whith solutinon using a [Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)(Also called CA) inspired by the conway game of life. After going back on the project and doing some reasearch on the subject I discovered half of my solution was already existing. This project is a fun aproach for a the maze generator.

## Algoritme
The 

## Neighborhood
This cellular automaton use 2 different neighborhoods.
The first one is a classical [Von Neumann Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood).


## The Rules
